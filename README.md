When I was 7 years old, I woke up early in the morning.
<br/>I wanted a different kind of breakfast,
<br/>So I took some soup from the fridge,it was cold freezing!

<br/>As I sat down to eat, I realized the soup was too cold for my liking.
<br/>But being a curious kid, I decided to experiment and heated it up in the microwave.
<br/>To my surprise, the soup tasted even better warm and became my new favorite breakfast.

</br>As I grew older, I started to experiment with different soup recipes, adding in different ingredients and spices.
</br>One day, while enjoying a bowl of soup, I felt something slimy on my tongue and quickly spit it out.
</br>To my _horror_, I saw a <span style="color:green">__small frog__</span> in my soup, and from that day on, I never looked at soup the same way again.

</br>I soon realized that my fear of finding something unexpected in my food extended beyond just soup.
</br>I became more cautious and inspected my meals thoroughly before taking a bite.
</br>Although the incident with the <span style="color:green">__frog__</span> in my soup was a _traumatic experience_, it taught me to be more mindful and aware of what I eat.
</br>Now, I make sure to always check my food before eating it, and I haven't had any unexpected surprises since.
