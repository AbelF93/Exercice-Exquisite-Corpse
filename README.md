# Exquisite-Corpse Collaboration Project

Welcome to our collaborative web development learning project! This project is part of our journey to improve our web development skills and learn effective collaboration using Git and GitHub. In this exercise, we've created an exquisite-corpse story where each of us contributes a part to the story and passes it on to the next person. Our team consists of:

- Steve Grards
- Thomas Moerman
- Julien Arnould
- [Your Name]

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to:

- Learn how to collaborate effectively using Git and GitHub.
- Practice branching, committing, and merging code changes.
- Create a fun and creative collaborative story.

## Project Structure

The project repository is organized as follows:

- `main` branch: The main branch will contain the final version of our exquisite-corpse story.
- Individual branches: Each team member will have their own branch to contribute to the story.
- Markdown files: Each contribution to the story should be written in a separate Markdown file.

## Collaboration Workflow

Our workflow for this project will follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Create a new branch for your contribution:

bash
Copy code
git checkout -b feature/your-name-story-part
Write your part of the story in a Markdown file within your branch.

Commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Add your-name's story part"
Push your branch to the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git push origin feature/your-name-story-part
Create a pull request (PR) to merge your branch into the main branch.

Review and discuss the PR with your team members.

Once the PR is approved, merge it into the main branch.

Continue the process by starting from step 2 with the next team member.

Now you can see below our "Excquisite-Corpse" exercice. Thank you for reading.

# __There was a _Frog_ in my _Soup___

<!-- Abel -->

When I was 7 years old, I woke up early in the morning.
<br/>I wanted a different kind of breakfast,
<br/>So I took some soup from the fridge,it was cold freezing!

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--Steve -->

<br/>As I sat down to eat, I realized the soup was too cold for my liking.
<br/>But being a curious kid, I decided to experiment and heated it up in the microwave.
<br/>To my surprise, the soup tasted even better warm and became my new favorite breakfast.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--Thom --> 

</br>As I grew older, I started to experiment with different soup recipes, adding in different ingredients and spices.
</br>One day, while enjoying a bowl of soup, I felt something slimy on my tongue and quickly spit it out.
</br>To my _horror_, I saw a <span style="color:green">__small frog__</span> in my soup, and from that day on, I never looked at soup the same way again.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<!--Julien -->

</br>I soon realized that my fear of finding something unexpected in my food extended beyond just soup.
</br>I became more cautious and inspected my meals thoroughly before taking a bite.
</br>Although the incident with the <span style="color:green">__frog__</span> in my soup was a _traumatic experience_, it taught me to be more mindful and aware of what I eat.
</br>Now, I make sure to always check my food before eating it, and I haven't had any unexpected surprises since.
