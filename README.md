# __There was a _Frog_ in my _Soup___

When I was 7 years old, I woke up early in the morning.
<br/>I wanted a different kind of breakfast,
<br/>So I took some soup that was cold freezing!

<br/>As I sat down to eat, I realized the soup was too cold for my liking.
<br/>But being a curious kid, I decided to experiment and heated it up in the microwave.
<br/>To my surprise, the soup tasted even better warm and became my new favorite breakfast.

</br>As I grew older, I started to experiment with different soup recipes, adding in different ingredients and spices.
</br>One day, while enjoying a bowl of soup, I felt something slimy on my tongue and quickly spit it out.
</br>To my horror, I saw a small frog in my soup, and from that day on, I never looked at soup the same way again.
